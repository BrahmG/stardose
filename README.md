StarDose
========

A recommender system for GitHub repositories. Uses `requests` as HTTP client.

* input: a username (to get the repos the user starred)
* output: other repos the user may be interested in

Edit `settings.py` and you're ready to run the scripts in order.

You might want to tweak `6_recommendations.py`, see comments in the source.
